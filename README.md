Bangin' on my chest.

These templates were designed, and the outputs generated by Base16 Builders.

The reversible scheme is intended to be consumed by the older Base16 Builders
that generate dark and light variants with the same scheme. The reversible
scheme is intended for use with the legacy type builders like:

- [Base16 Builder](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-builder) by [Chris
  Kempson](https://github.com/chriskempson)
- [Base16 Builder](https://github.com/base16-builder/base16-builder) by
  [base16-builder](https://github.com/base16-builder)

The light and dark themes are for consumption by newer builders that expect
to generate only one variant. You could use the light and dark variants against
builders like

- [Base16 Builder PHP](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-builder-php) by
[Chris Kempson](https://github.com/chriskempson)

To update the theme, adjust the colors in the schema file then use base16-builder to generate the output.
